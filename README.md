## Run

This app is hosted on Heroku:

[Sales Forecast App](https://instantoffice.herokuapp.com/)


  
## Animated Graphs

I created these animated graphs with JavaScript and D3 as a way to dynamically and iteractively impart the data. The goal was to get the user engaged with the data, as I believe that facilitates understanding and retention while encouraging exploration. Mousing over any month on the main graph triggers the animation for the other graphs.

## Tools

JavaScript, D3, Bootstrap, Jupyter Notebook, HTML5, CSS, Flask, Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Facebook Prophet (machine learning)



## Data
Sample data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting).  Forecast modeling was completed with Facebook Prophet. 
Results of the forecast models were saved as CSVs to the Resource folder and then brought into the heroku app.

Data was cleaned in SQLite, which I further processed in JavaScript.
