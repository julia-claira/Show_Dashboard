This app is hosted on Heroku:

[Science Fiction Strreaming App](https://scifi-stream.herokuapp.com/)


## Tools

PostgreSQL, Python, Flask, Pandas, Splinter, JavaScript, D3, Bootstrap, Jupyter Notebook, HTML5, CSS, SQLite, SQLAlchemy



## Data

I scraped the data from [FlixPatrol](https://www.flixpatrol.com) using Splinter and BeautifulSoup in Python, then inserted results into a SQL database.

The Flask App queries the SQL database, and the data is further processed in JavaScript.

## Graphs

In exploring science fiction streaming prefernce by gender, I found no marked difference between men and women in the youngest demographic.
